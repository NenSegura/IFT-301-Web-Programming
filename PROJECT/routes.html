                <h2>Short Reads</h2>
                <p>If you're looking to have a read that includes some but not all the additional stories, here are routes that are brief but also includes some detail connecting to the series!</p>
                <!--Insert list of different routes here and their place in the reading list-->
                <h3 class="routeNum">Route 1: The series and just the series.</h3>
                <p>You do not have to add extra books to the already lengthy series! It is a great journey by its self if you don't want to dedicate a huge amount of time to get to the end. The only recommendation in this route is to read the first book again after finishing the series. Reading the first book again should help everything in the first book make more sense and provide those "ah ha" moments.</p>
                <h3 class="routeNum">Route 2: The Essentials </h3>
                <p>This read only includes 3 additional books: <strong>The Stand</strong>, <strong>Insomnia</strong>, <strong>'Salem's Lot</strong>. These are recommended to provide background information that serves to enhance the <em>Dark Tower</em> stories.</p>

                <h3 class="routeNum">Route 3: Highly Recommended </h3>
                <p>After some research, I made this route that includes all of the stories that were deamed necessary to reading the books. This includes the short stories <strong> The Little Sisters of Eluria</strong> and <strong>Everything's Eventual</strong> from <em>Everything's Eventual</em> which is a collection of short stories, as well as <strong>Low Men in Yellow Coats</strong> from the book <em>Hearts in Atlantis</em>.</p>

                <p>For those who want to experience the <em>Dark Tower</em> in its entirety, here are some routes that include all the additional books to provide you with the information to understand the series indepth.</p>
                <!--Insert list of different routes here and their place in the reading list-->
                <h3 class="routeNum">Route 1: Complimentary </h3>
                <p>This path includes the essentials as well as other readings that don't necesarrily have the most connection to the series, but do provide nice details that bring a little more enjoyment to the journey. These include: <strong>The Talisman</strong>, <strong>IT</strong>, and <strong>Black House</strong> bringing the total reading count to 9 additional and 17 in total.</p>

                <h3 class="routeNum">Route 2: Everything Else</h3>
                <p>This route includes the addition of <strong>The Eyes of the Dragon</strong>,<strong>The Mist</strong>, <strong>Rose Madder</strong>, <strong>Desperation</strong>, and <strong>The Regulators</strong>. All for a total of 14 additional and 22 books all together. Once again, you do not have to read all of these, and some people have even commented saying that some of these do not add anything at all. I'm just including them to give readers the option to explore it for themselves. These are said to give the most detail and the most in depth understanding to the reference and plot of the <em>Dark Tower</em> books.</p>
