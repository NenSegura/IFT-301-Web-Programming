            <p id="authortxt">Stephen King was born 1947 in Portland, Maine. He graduated from the University of Maine in 1970 with a B.A. in English and in 71 he began teaching high school English at Hampden Academy in Maine. The author still wrote during free time and eventually was accepted by Doubleday & Co. in 1973 for his story, Carrie. Since then, King has released over 50 novels, obtained the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal, as well as the 2014 National Medal of Arts.</p>

            <h2>The Dark Tower</h2>
            <p id="towertxt">
                He is the last gunslinger in Mid World and must travel to other worlds on his quest to defeat a personal enemy and rid the world of impending doom. Roland Deschain must journey to the Dark Tower, which serves as the powerful connector for all worlds, in order to fulfill his mission using ignoble technology of the Great Older Ones. Along the way, a drift in time and direction occurs, and the six magnetic beams responsible for maintaining time, space, size, and dimension begin to weaken. It is up to Roland to restore reality and save all worlds.
            </p>
            <p>This collection of books serves as a connector to the worlds of other King novels. While perfectly fine and enjoyable by itself, readers have picked up on the connecting details after reading the novels, and created their own orders in which the books should be read with additional works of King. It truly is a story that continues to leave readers in awe and wonderment.</p>
